Introduction

This project explores the dynamics of Tesla’s stock market, aiming to identify trends and forecast future prices. Using historical data from 2013 to 2023, the analysis incorporates ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models to predict Tesla’s closing stock prices for 2024.

Data Overview

	•	Data Source: Yahoo Finance API using the yfinance library.
	•	Data Description: Daily trading metrics, including open, high, low, close, volume, dividends, and stock splits.
	•	Key Observations:
	•	Tesla’s stock price increased by 10,549.3% from 2013 to 2023.
	•	Significant fluctuations, especially in 2020 and 2022, reflecting market volatility.

Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

	•	Candlestick Plots: Visualize daily stock movements.
	•	Stock Splits: Analysis of Tesla’s stock splits in 2020 and 2022 and their impact.
	•	Percentage Change Analysis: Evaluate stock volatility using percentage change metrics.
	•	Autocorrelation Analysis: Understand the correlation of Tesla’s stock price with its past values.

Time Series Models

ARIMA Model

	•	Model Description: ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) captures linear trends and seasonality.
	•	Stationarity Check: Conducted using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
	•	Model Parameters: Determined using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).
	•	Model Evaluation: ARIMA(1, 1, 1) performed well but indicated heteroskedasticity in residuals.

Exponential Smoothing

	•	Simple Exponential Smoothing: Assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.
	•	Holt’s Method: Accounts for both trend and level using smoothing parameters alpha and beta.
	•	Model Results: Holt’s method outperformed SES, indicating room for further optimization.

Forecasting Analysis

	•	Predictions: Forecasted Tesla’s closing price for 2024, estimating a closing price near $248.48.
	•	Train-Test Split: Models were validated using a train-test split, and performance metrics were analyzed.
	•	Residual Analysis: Residuals were examined for normality, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity.

Practical Applications

Time series forecasting for Tesla stock can aid investors, traders, and financial analysts in making data-driven decisions, optimizing portfolio strategies, managing risks, and developing trading algorithms.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrated that Holt’s Exponential Smoothing outperformed ARIMA in predicting Tesla’s stock price. However, the models require further fine-tuning and exploration of alternative methods to improve accuracy. Future work could involve incorporating more complex models or additional features like macroeconomic indicators.
